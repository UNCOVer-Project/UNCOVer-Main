				A sightless person has difficulties in indentifying objects. But, it doesn't mean that a sightless person cannot identify and remember objects because their other senses work better than most of normal people as a natural compensation due to their deficiency. They can sense their surroundings and know the presence of objects with their heightened  perception.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px">
					But, with all of their adaptation, there is still one differentiating factor that makes them less precise in detecting object, that is finding and locating small sized and complex shaped object.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px">
					In general scenario, a sightless person is very dependant in memory and their senses. They can quickly identify objects that are routinely used and remember, but may have difficulties indentifying completely new object and/or in different/unusual locations.
